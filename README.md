### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Run it Locally (Without a Backend)**
If you only need the frontend, you can run it in a browser with just an HTML file:

#### **Step 1: Create `index.html`**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Love Story App</title>
</head>
<body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script type="module">
        import { createRoot } from "https://esm.sh/react-dom@18.2.0/client";
        import React from "https://esm.sh/react@18.2.0";
        import App from "./app.js";  // Create app.js with your React code
        createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(React.createElement(App));
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

#### **Step 2: Create `app.js`**
- Copy your React component code into `app.js`
- Open `index.html` in a browser.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Run it Locally with a Full Development Setup**
If you want to develop and test with a full local setup, follow these steps:

#### **Step 1: Install Node.js**
Download and install **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)** if you haven't already.

#### **Step 2: Set Up the Project**
```sh
mkdir love-story-app
cd love-story-app
npm init -y
```

#### **Step 3: Install Dependencies**
```sh
npm install react react-dom lucide-react nanoid vite express sqlite3
```

#### **Step 4: Create `index.html` in the `public/` Folder**
Same as the HTML code above but inside `public/index.html`.

#### **Step 5: Create React App in `src/`**
Create a `src` folder and inside it, create `main.jsx`:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App";
createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(<App />);
```

#### **Step 6: Add `App.jsx`**
- Copy your full React component code into `src/App.jsx`.

#### **Step 7: Run the Development Server**
```sh
npm run dev
```
- Open the URL provided by Vite (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`).
